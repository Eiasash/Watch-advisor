## Passed On

| Watch | Date | Reason |
|-------|------|--------|
| Zenith Port Royal V | Jan 2025 | Offered at 12k NIS via Timor Josef. Passed — saving for Chronomaster tricolor instead. |

| Tudor Black Bay 58 Burgundy | Feb 2025 | Gap filled by BB41 Red acquisition. |

Dropped from wishlist.** Alpine Eagle 8HF fills the high-frequency precision role more compellingly (57,600 vph vs 36,000 vph). Tricolor chrono would have been 4th chronograph in collection. Financial headroom redirected toward Alpine Eagle 8HF acquisition. |
| Oris Big Crown Pointer Date | Feb 2025 | Ref 754 7741 4068, 40mm burgundy dial. Passed. |
| VC Overseas 4500V White (rep) | Feb 2025 | Passed — already 6+ white/ivory dials in collection. |
| VC Overseas 7900V Dual Time White (rep) | Feb 2025 | Passed — white dial surplus. |
| VC Overseas Ultra-Thin 2000V Grey (rep) | Feb 2025 | Passed — grey/silver space owned by Snowflake. |
| IWC Ingenieur Grey (rep) | Feb 2025 | Passed — Snowflake covers quiet silver. |
| IWC Ingenieur Blue (rep) | Feb 2025 | Passed — blue integrated bracelet owned by GP Laureato. |
| Glashutte Original SeaQ Blue (rep) | Feb 2025 | Passed — not interested in German blue diver. |
| Omega Aqua Terra Burgundy (rep) | Feb 2025 | Considered for oxblood gap. Chose VC Overseas Perpetual Calendar burgundy instead. |
| Panerai Luminor Due Brown (rep) | Feb 2025 | Considered for brown gap. Deferred — brown not urgent. |
