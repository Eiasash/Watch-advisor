## Changelog

| Version | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| **v25.5** | 🐛 Fix wardrobe photos not displaying after reload — `preloadPhotos()` now dispatches `wa-photo-ready` event to trigger React re-render. 🔤 Wardrobe grid font sizes increased across the board (names 9→11px, types 7→9px, badges 6→8px). Photo thumbnails enlarged 90→100px, wider grid columns. |
| **v25.4** | ⚡ VirtualGrid: hybrid windowing for wardrobe grid. Only visible pages in DOM, off-screen pages become spacers. IO-based auto-pagination replaces "Show More" button. |
| **v25.3** | Fix blank screen — orphaned `const DEFAULT_CX=[` in utils.js broke module parse. |
| **v25.2** | Unworn rotation: "Fresh" toggle, 14d+ badges, neglected wardrobe insight. SW escape hatch: Force button, CLEAR_ALL_CACHES, controllerchange auto-reload. |
| **v25.1** | ES module split (monolith → 7 modules). Undo toasts, haptic feedback, tab slide animations, lazy image loading. |
| **v24.14** | Content-visibility tuning, color sampling accuracy, dHash logging. |
| **v24.13** | Multi-select garments, dHash duplicate detection, constrained AI. |
